<h4><b>Definitions and legal references</h4></b><br>


<b>Personal Data (or Data)</b><br>

Any information that directly, indirectly, or in connection with other information — including a personal identification number — allows for the identification or identifiability of a natural person.<br><br>

<b>User</b><br>

The individual using this Application who, unless otherwise specified, coincides with the Data Subject.<br><br>

<b>Data Subject</b><br>

The natural person to whom the Personal Data refers.<br><br>

<b>Data Processor (or Processor)</b><br>

<b>Data Controller (or Owner)</b><br>

The natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Data, including the security measures concerning the operation and use of this Application. The Data Controller, unless otherwise specified, is the Owner of this Application.<br><br>

<b>This Application</b><br>

The means by which the Personal Data of the User is collected and processed.<br><br>

<b>Service</b><br>

<b>European Union (or EU)</b><br>

Unless otherwise specified, all references made within this document to the European Union include all current member states to the European Union and the European Economic Area.<br><br>

<b>Cookie</b><br>

Cookies are Trackers consisting of small sets of data stored in the User's device.<br><br>

<b>Tracker</b><br>

Tracker indicates any technology - e.g Cookies, unique identifiers, web beacons, embedded scripts, e-tags and fingerprinting - that enables the tracking of Users, for example by accessing or storing information on the User’s device.<br><br><br>



<b><i>Legal information</i></b><br>

This policy has been prepared based on provisions of multiple legislations.<br>

This policy relates solely to this Application, if not stated otherwise within this document.<br><br><br>

<hr><br><br>

This document informs Users about the technologies that help this Application to achieve the purposes described below. Such technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a script) on a User’s device as they interact with this Application.<br><br>

For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as "Trackers" within this document – unless there is a reason to differentiate.<br><br>
For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.<br><br>

Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User's consent. Whenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.<br><br>

This Application uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called “first-party” Trackers) and Trackers that enable services provided by a third-party (so-called “third-party” Trackers). Unless otherwise specified within this document, third-party providers may access the Trackers managed by them.<br><br>

The validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by the Owner or the relevant provider. Some of them expire upon termination of the application session.<br><br>

In addition to what’s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below, Users may find more precise and updated information regarding lifetime specification as well as any other relevant information – such as the presence of other Trackers - in the linked privacy policies of the respective third-party providers or by contacting the Owner.<br><br>

<h4><b>Activities strictly necessary for the operation of this Application and delivery of the Service</b></h4><br>

This Application uses so-called “technical” Cookies and other similar Trackers to carry out activities that are strictly necessary for the operation or delivery of the Service.<br><br>

<h4><b>Other activities involving the use of Trackers</b></h4><br> 

<b>Measurement.</b> This Application uses trackers to measure traffic and analyze User behavior in order to improve the Service. This is implemented using:<br><br>

<b>Google Analytics</b><br><br>

This service enable the Owner to monitor and analyse traffic and can be used to keep track of User behaviour.<br><br>
<b>Google Analytics for Firebase (for apps) (Google Ireland Limited)</b><br><br>

Google Analytics for Firebase (for apps) or Firebase Analytics is an analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited.
In order to understand Google's use of Data, consult
<a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">Google's partner policy.</a><br><br>

Firebase Analytics may share Data with other tools provided by Firebase. The User may check privacy policy to find a detailed explanation about the other tools used by the Owner.<br><br>

This Application uses identifiers for mobile devices and technologies similar to cookies to run the Firebase Analytics service.<br><br>

Users may opt-out of certain Firebase Analytics features through applicable device settings, such as the device advertising settings for mobile phones or by following the instructions in related sections of privacy policy, if available.<br><br>

Personal Data processed: Application opens, Application updates, device information, geography/region, launches, number of sessions, number of Users, operating systems, session duration, Trackers, unique device identifiers for advertising (Google Advertiser ID or IDFA, for example) and Usage Data.<br><br>

Place of processing: Ireland.<br><br>

<h4><b>How to manage preferences</b></h4><br>

There are various ways to manage Tracker related preferences:<br><br>

Users can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly within their own device settings, for example, by preventing the use or storage of Trackers.<br><br>

Additionally Users can set their preferences via the relevant consent-preferences privacy widget.<br><br>

It is also possible, via device features, to delete previously stored Trackers, including those used to remember the User’s initial consent preferences.<br><br>

With regard to any third-party Trackers, Users can manage their preferences via the related opt-out link (where provided), by using the means indicated in the third party's privacy policy, or by contacting the third party.<br><br>

<b>Locating Tracker Settings</b><br><br>

Users may also manage certain categories of Trackers used on mobile apps by opting out through relevant device settings such as the device advertising settings for mobile devices, or tracking settings in general (Users may open the device settings and look for the relevant setting).<br><br>

<b>Consequences of denying the use of Trackers</b><br><br>

Users are free to decide whether or not to allow the use of Trackers. However, please note that Trackers help this Application to provide a better experience and advanced functionalities to Users (in line with the purposes outlined in this document). Therefore, if the User chooses to block the use of Trackers, the Owner may be unable to provide related features.<br><br>

<h4><b>Owner and Data Controller </b></h4>

Patryk Kołodziej ("PTK")<br><br>

<b>Owner contact email:</b> chatana@consultant.com<br><br>

Since the use of third-party Trackers through this Application cannot be fully controlled by the Owner, any specific references to third-party Trackers are to be considered indicative. In order to obtain complete information, Users are kindly requested to consult the privacy policies of the respective third-party services listed in this document.<br><br>

Given the objective complexity surrounding tracking technologies, Users are encouraged to contact the Owner should they wish to receive any further information on the use of such technologies by this Application.<br><br>
