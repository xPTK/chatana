<li>Mobile Device Data. We automatically collect device information (such as your mobile device ID, model, and manufacturer), operating system, version information and system configuration information, device and application identification numbers, browser type and version, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, and Internet Protocol (IP) address (or proxy server). If you are using our Mobile Application, we may also collect information about the phone network associated with your mobile device, your mobile device’s operating system or platform, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device’s unique device ID, and information about the features of our Mobile Application you accessed.</li><br>

This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.<br><br>

Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.<br><br>

The information we collect includes:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Log and Usage Data.</b> Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called 'crash dumps'), and hardware settings).</li><br>

<li><b>Location Data.</b> We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</li><br>

<li><b>Crash and errors data.</b> We collect crash and errors data such as crash report, device information and universally unique identifier (UUID). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information by choosing not to send this information to us.</li><br>

<b>In Short:</b> We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.<br><br>

<b>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:</b><br>

<ul>
    
<li><b>To facilitate account creation and authentication and otherwise manage user accounts.</b> We may process your information so you can create and log in to your account, as well as keep your account in working order.</li><br>

<li><b>To deliver and facilitate delivery of services to the user.</b> We may process your information to provide you with the requested service.</li><br>

<li><b>To save or protect an individual's vital interest.</b> We may process your information when necessary to save or protect an individual’s vital interest, such as to prevent harm.</li><br>
</ul>

<h3>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h3><br>

<b>In Short:</b> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.<br><br>

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:<br>

<ul>
<li><b>Consent.</b> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li><br>

<li><b>Performance of a Contract.</b> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li><br>

<li><b>Legitimate Interests.</b> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</li><br>
<ul>
<li>Develop and display personalised and relevant advertising content for our users</li><br>
<li>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</li><br>
</ul>

<li><b>Legal Obligations.</b> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li><br>

<li><b>Vital Interests.</b> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li><br>
</ul>

<h3>5. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</h3><br>

<b>In Short:</b> We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third parties that we may link to or who advertise on our Services, but are not affiliated with our Services.<br><br>

The Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications and/or contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, services, or applications. Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy policy. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Services. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.<br><br>



<h3>6. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h3><br>

We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect, access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our <a href="https://xptk.github.io/chatana/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.<br><br>


<h3>7. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</h3><br>

<b>In Short:</b> We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.<br><br>

Our servers are located in Belgium, and Netherlands. If you are accessing our Services from outside Belgium, and Netherlands, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see 'WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?' above), in Ireland, United States, and other countries.<br><br>

If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable law.<br><br>

European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses:<br><br>

We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.<br><br>


<h3>8. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3><br>

<b>In Short:</b> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.<br><br>

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than three (3) months past the termination of the user's account.<br><br>

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.<br><br>



<h3>9. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3><br>

<b>In Short:</b> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.<br><br>

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.<br><br>


<h3>10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3><br>

<b>In Short:</b> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Switzerland, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.<br><br>

In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Switzerland), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS POLICY?' below.<br><br>

We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.<br><br>

If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.<br><br>

If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.<br><br>

<b>Withdrawing your consent:</b> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by updating your preferences in the Mobile Application settings.<br><br>

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.<br><br>


<b>Account Information</b><br><br>

If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:
<ul>
<li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
<li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li><br>
</ul>

Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.<br><br>

<b>Cookies and similar technologies:</b> If you prefer, you can reject cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. You may also opt out of interest-based advertising by advertisers on our Services.<br><br>

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at chatana@consultant.com.<br><br>



<h3>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3><br>

Some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.<br><br>



<h3>12. PRIVACY OF CHILDREN</h3><br>

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information through the Mobile Application and Services. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us through the Mobile Application and Services, please contact us to request that we delete that child’s personal information from our Services. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from anyone under the age of 13, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.<br>
We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce this policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information through the Mobile Application and Services.<br><br>

If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information and your country requires consent from a parent, we may require your parent's consent before we collect and use that information.<br><br>



<h3>13. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?</h3><br>

<b>In Short:</b> Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.<br><br>

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated 'Revised' date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.<br><br>



<h3>14. HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS POLICY?</h3><br>

If you have questions or comments about this policy, you may email us at <b>chatana@consultant.com.</b><br><br>
